One option is direct/directly removal/remove of salt from the lake’s water in special desalination facilities/equipment/factory. 
P1. use synonyms
P2. keep the word root, but use a different form
P3. change the sentence structure: SVO – OVS
First, special equipment can be used to remove salt from the lake. This equipment allows water to evaporate and return to the lake while leaving salt separate. 1+1
However, the professor points out that there are potential health risks.
This is due to the salt left behind after desalination. It contains not only salt, but also harmful materials like selirium, which can be spread by wind and cause potential problems if human beings breathe it into their lungs. 1+2/3
